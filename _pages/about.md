  bio: |
    Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite subreddit.
    You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in — just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg`
    and put it into the `img/` folder.

    Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable
    any of these elements by editing `profile` in this file. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib`
    and Jekyll will render your publications page automatically.

    This theme is set up to use Font Awesome icons and Academicons. Add your
    Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or disable all of them.
